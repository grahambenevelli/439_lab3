\section{Part 2: MaxNWScheduler}

{\em At most 1/2 page -- Discuss high level design, any issues/known
  bugs for part 2}

{\em Discuss your testing strategy -- what tests did you run, what were the
results?  (Feel free to include graphs in your turnin.) You should
provide instructions for the TA to run your tests, but you should also
make sure that the results of your runs (graphs, data files, etc.) are
in files that will not be overwritten if the TA tries to reproduce
your results.}

{\em Anything the TA needs to know about when grading part 2? Known bugs?
Interesting design points?}
